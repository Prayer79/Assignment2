1. Introduction

   In the era of artificial intelligence, high-quality training data plays a critical role in the development of reliable AI models. Our client, an AI developer, is using web scraping to collect publicly available data for training purposes. However, they are facing challenges in structuring the data effectively and ensuring that the dataset remains unbiased.
   This document outlines the functional and system requirements, explores assumptions and validation, and presents implementation tasks to help move the project forward while following software engineering best practices.

2. Problem Statement

   The client requires:
   Categorized training questions separate from answers – This ensures that developers can work on improving AI-generated responses without interference from pre-existing answers.
   Balanced training data – AI models must not be trained on biased datasets, as this could lead to unfair or inaccurate outputs.
   Our role is to define clear requirements, validate assumptions, and create an actionable plan to overcome these challenges.

3. Requirements Definition

3.1 Functional Requirements
Data Categorization System
• The system must categorize training questions based on topics such as programming languages, algorithms, AI ethics, and troubleshooting.

• Each category must be stored separately from the corresponding answers to allow independent refinement.

• Developers must be able to search and filter questions based on categories.

• The system must support bulk import and export of categorized questions and answers.

Bias Detection and Mitigation

• The system must analyze training data for potential biases based on factors such as gender, region, and language usage.

• Implement an automated bias-checking mechanism that flags and highlights skewed datasets for review.

• The system must generate a report highlighting potential biases in the dataset.

• Developers must have the ability to review and modify flagged biased data.

• The system must provide an option to balance training data by suggesting missing categories.

Data Validation Process

• Implement a mechanism to validate the accuracy and relevance of scraped data before inclusion in the training dataset.

• Allow developers to manually approve or reject new training questions.
API for Data Management

• Provide an API that allows developers to interact with categorized questions and answers efficiently.

• API should support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for training data.

User Access and Role Management

• The system must support multiple user roles, including developers, data analysts, and administrators.

• Only authorized users should be able to modify or approve categorized training data.

• Developers should have a personal dashboard displaying their reviewed and pending data entries.

Web Scraping Data Processing

• The system must automatically categorize scraped data into appropriate topics.

• The system must validate and clean scraped data before storing it in the database.

• Developers should be able to manually review and edit scraped data before it is finalized.

• The system must prevent duplicate questions from being stored.

3.2 System Requirements

Web Scraping Framework

• The system should use an efficient web scraping tool (e.g., Scrapy, BeautifulSoup) that ensures compliance with website terms of service.
Database Management System

• A structured database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) should be used to store categorized questions and answers separately.

• The system must use a scalable database to handle large volumes of categorized training data.

• The system must perform automatic daily backups to prevent data loss.

• The system must support version control for training datasets to allow rollback when needed.

Scalability & Performance

• The system should support processing at least 100,000 new training questions per day.

• Data retrieval operations must not exceed 2 seconds for a standard query.

• The system should support concurrent access by at least 500 users without performance degradation.

Security & Compliance

• The system must encrypt stored user credentials and sensitive data.

• The system must follow data privacy regulations, including GDPR and CCPA compliance.

• Only authenticated users should have access to sensitive AI training data.

• Implement safeguards against unauthorized access to training data.

Integration & Compatibility

• The system must provide an API for integration with existing AI model training workflows.

• The system must be compatible with common data formats (CSV, JSON, XML) for easy import/export.

• The system should support integration with cloud-based AI services for automated analysis.

4. Assumptions and Validation Plan
   4.1 Assumptions
   • The client has the legal right to scrape and use publicly available data and understands compliance with web scraping policies.
   • AI developers prefer separate question-answer storage for better training model adjustments, reducing redundancy and enabling efficient data retrieval.
   • The client is open to integrating automated bias detection into their data pipeline, ensuring that the training data does not reinforce prejudices or systemic biases.
   • The dataset is continuously growing and will need frequent updates, requiring a scalable solution that can handle increasing volumes of data efficiently.
   • The AI model's performance is directly influenced by the structure and balance of the dataset, emphasizing the need for continuous quality checks.

4.2 Validation Plan
• Client Collaboration: Conduct regular meetings with the client to ensure that categorized data format aligns with their business and technical requirements.
• AI Model Performance Testing: Run sample AI models on both raw and processed data to measure improvements in model accuracy, bias reduction, and response consistency.
• Bias Detection Review: Perform manual reviews of flagged biased data to assess the effectiveness of the bias detection system. If bias detection algorithms yield false positives or false negatives, iterative improvements will be made.
• API Usability Testing: Gather feedback from developers using the API to ensure it meets usability, efficiency, and integration requirements.
• Scalability and Performance Benchmarking: Evaluate system performance by stress-testing data retrieval speeds and concurrent user handling capacity.
• Security Audits: Conduct periodic security assessments to confirm encryption strength and access control measures align with best practices and legal compliance.
