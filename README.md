1. Introduction

   In the era of artificial intelligence, high-quality training data plays a critical role in the development of reliable AI models. Our client, an AI developer, is using web scraping to collect publicly available data for training purposes. However, they are facing challenges in structuring the data effectively and ensuring that the dataset remains unbiased.
   This document outlines the functional and system requirements, explores assumptions and validation, and presents implementation tasks to help move the project forward while following software engineering best practices.

2. Problem Statement

   The client requires:
   Categorized training questions separate from answers – This ensures that developers can work on improving AI-generated responses without interference from pre-existing answers.
   Balanced training data – AI models must not be trained on biased datasets, as this could lead to unfair or inaccurate outputs.
   Our role is to define clear requirements, validate assumptions, and create an actionable plan to overcome these challenges.

3. Requirements Definition

3.1 Functional Requirements
Data Categorization System
• The system must categorize training questions based on topics such as programming languages, algorithms, AI ethics, and troubleshooting.
• Each category must be stored separately from the corresponding answers to allow independent refinement.
• Developers must be able to search and filter questions based on categories.
• The system must support bulk import and export of categorized questions and answers.

Bias Detection and Mitigation
• The system must analyze training data for potential biases based on factors such as gender, region, and language usage.
• Implement an automated bias-checking mechanism that flags and highlights skewed datasets for review.
• The system must generate a report highlighting potential biases in the dataset.
• Developers must have the ability to review and modify flagged biased data.
• The system must provide an option to balance training data by suggesting missing categories.
Data Validation Process
• Implement a mechanism to validate the accuracy and relevance of scraped data before inclusion in the training dataset.
• Allow developers to manually approve or reject new training questions.
API for Data Management
• Provide an API that allows developers to interact with categorized questions and answers efficiently.
• API should support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for training data.
User Access and Role Management
• The system must support multiple user roles, including developers, data analysts, and administrators.
• Only authorized users should be able to modify or approve categorized training data.
• Developers should have a personal dashboard displaying their reviewed and pending data entries.
Web Scraping Data Processing
• The system must automatically categorize scraped data into appropriate topics.
• The system must validate and clean scraped data before storing it in the database.
• Developers should be able to manually review and edit scraped data before it is finalized.
• The system must prevent duplicate questions from being stored.
