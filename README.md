1. Introduction
   In the era of artificial intelligence, high-quality training data plays a critical role in the development of reliable AI models. Our client, an AI developer, is using web scraping to collect publicly available data for training purposes. However, they are facing challenges in structuring the data effectively and ensuring that the dataset remains unbiased.
   This document outlines the functional and system requirements, explores assumptions and validation, and presents implementation tasks to help move the project forward while following software engineering best practices.

2. Problem Statement
   The client requires:
   Categorized training questions separate from answers – This ensures that developers can work on improving AI-generated responses without interference from pre-existing answers.
   Balanced training data – AI models must not be trained on biased datasets, as this could lead to unfair or inaccurate outputs.
   Our role is to define clear requirements, validate assumptions, and create an actionable plan to overcome these challenges.
