1. Introduction
   In the era of artificial intelligence, high-quality training data plays a critical role in the development of reliable AI models. Our client, an AI developer, is using web scraping to collect publicly available data for training purposes. However, they are facing challenges in structuring the data effectively and ensuring that the dataset remains unbiased.
   This document outlines the functional and system requirements, explores assumptions and validation, and presents implementation tasks to help move the project forward while following software engineering best practices.
